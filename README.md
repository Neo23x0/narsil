Narsil - Spy Agency Teasing
======
Narsil is meant as a defense tool with various functions. 

Nasty EXIF
======
One function is to trigger alerts or generate errors in the NSA XKeyscore system by generating files with metadata that are highly suspicious. Nasty EXIF changes the EXIF Metadata of JPEG files to high profile GPS locations. You can select a single file or a directory. To make blacklisting of those files nearly impossible, I integrated a random generator for the GPS coordinates. Locations will be 0 to around 700 meters around the NSA Headquarter, Pentagon and Keith Alexanders new "private" work place. 

Encrypted ZIP Bomb
======
This will be an encrypted ZIP file generator that packs numerous equal characters of an arbitraty symbol into an encrypted ZIP file with an easily guessable password like "abc" and a high profile word in the file name like "civil_rights_demo_confidential.zip". The encrypted file contains more than 50 GB of data.
This will not do harm to any AV system on the transit, as they do not crack simple ZIP passwords. But the NSA and other criminals do. ;)

HoneyDocs
======
The HoneyDocs Feature will also be integrated in future release

Sources
======
To execute narsil.py you'll need a copy of Kivy. Download it from [here](http://kivy.org/#download). Than start kivy.bat and navigate to the narsil directory. Run narsil with "python narsil.py".

You can build it on your own with PyInstaller. Find tutorials [here](http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-windows.html)

Binaries
======
Binaries should run on all Windows Systems with OpenGL 2.x+ - If you want to run it in Virtual Machines, you should consider that.
